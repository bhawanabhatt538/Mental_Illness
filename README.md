# Medical Illness Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of medical illnesses based on various demographic, behavioral, and health-related factors. The dataset contains information about individuals, including their age, marital status, education level, smoking status, physical activity, employment status, and several health-related habits and conditions. The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can assist in identifying individuals who might be at higher risk of medical illnesses based on these factors.

### Key Features
- **Predictive Model**: A machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of an individual developing a medical illness based on their attributes (e.g., age, marital status, smoking status, physical activity).
- **User Input**: Users can input personal information, and the model will provide a prediction on their risk of medical illness.
- **Data Analysis**: Insights into how different factors like income, family history, and lifestyle choices affect the likelihood of medical conditions.
